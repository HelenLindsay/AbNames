# Check gene biotype of ensembl genes
# Remove if same symbol mapped to two different ensembl genes?
# e.g. one NCBI SYMBOL to many HGNC symbols or ENSEMBL genes
# Check ensembl mapping location matches map_location (only one should?)

# check whether each ensembl id in hgnc maps to only one hgnc symbol / id

# check whether unofficial symbols map to a different official gene
# ENSG00000203668: Entrez gene symbol CHML, HGNC symbol OPN3 -
# both are valid HGNC symbols

# Single NCBI maps to multiple ENSEMBL, are both locations valid?
# Do they produce the same protein?  Does Protein Ontology differentiate?
